# AKS Storage -  Storage Classes, Persistent Volume Claims

## Step-01: Introduction
- We are going to create a MySQL Database with persistence storage using **Azure Disks** 

| Kubernetes Object  | YAML File |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Storage Class  | 01-storage-class.yml |
| Persistent Volume Claim | 02-persistent-volume-claim.yml   |
| Config Map  | 03-UserManagement-ConfigMap.yml  |
| Deployment, Environment Variables, Volumes, VolumeMounts  | 04-mysql-deployment.yml  |
| ClusterIP Service  | 05-mysql-clusterip-service.yml  |

## Step-02: Create following Kubernetes manifests
### Create Storage Class manifest
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#volume-binding-mode
- **Important Note:** `WaitForFirstConsumer` mode will delay the volume binding and provisioning  of a PersistentVolume until a Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim is created. 

### Create Persistent Volume Claims manifest
```
# Create Storage Class & PVC
kubectl apply -f kube-manifests/

# List Storage Classes
kubectl get sc

# List PVC
kubectl get pvc 

# List PV
kubectl get pv
```
### Create ConfigMap manifest
- We are going to create a `usermgmt` database schema during the mysql pod creation time which we will leverage when we deploy User Management Microservice. 

### Create MySQL Deployment manifest
- Environment Variables
- Volumes
- Volume Mounts

### Create MySQL ClusterIP Service manifest
- At any point of time we are going to have only one mysql pod in this design so `ClusterIP: None` will use the `Pod IP Address` instead of creating or allocating a separate IP for `MySQL Cluster IP service`.   

## Step-03: Create MySQL Database with all above manifests
```
# Create MySQL Database
kubectl apply -f kube-manifests/

# List Storage Classes
kubectl get sc

# List PVC
kubectl get pvc 

# List PV
kubectl get pv

# List pods
kubectl get pods 

# List pods based on  label name
kubectl get pods -l app=mysql
```

## Step-04: Connect to MySQL Database
```
# Connect to MYSQL Database
kubectl run -it --rm --image=mysql:5.6 --restart=Never mysql-client -- mysql -h mysql -pdbpassword11

# Verify usermgmt schema got created which we provided in ConfigMap
mysql> show schemas;
```

## Step-05: Clean-Up 
```
# Delete All
kubectl delete -f kube-manifests/
```

## Step-06: Discuss about PV - Retain policy
```
# List PV
kubect get pv

# Delete PV
kubect delete pv <PV-Name>
```
- Note
```
Retain
The Retain reclaim policy allows for manual reclamation of the resource. When the PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted, the PersistentVolume still exists and the volume is considered "released". But it is not yet available for another claim because the previous claimant's data remains on the volume. An administrator can manually reclaim the volume with the following steps.

Delete the PersistentVolume. The associated storage asset in external infrastructure (such as an AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or Cinder volume) still exists after the PV is deleted.
Manually clean up the data on the associated storage asset accordingly.
Manually delete the associated storage asset, or if you want to reuse the same storage asset, create a new PersistentVolume with the storage asset definition.
```
